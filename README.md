# PSL-Prediction
This repository contains code for predicting the outcome of Pakistan Super League (PSL) matches based on random forest classifier. 
Please note that I dont claim that the results of the model are perfect. This repository is just for inspiration. Considering that I used very few features in my model, I think
the results are quite plausible.

Having said that feel free to give suggestions or point any bugs in the code.
